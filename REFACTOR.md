# Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the steps to refactor the existing PHP application to improve its structure, maintainability, and security.

## 1. Introduce a Lightweight Framework

- **Goal:** Replace the manual routing and controller instantiation with a modern framework.
- **Recommendation:** Adopt a minimal framework like [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) or a similar micro-framework.
- **Steps:**
    1. Install Slim via Composer.
    2. Create a new entry point (e.g., `public/index.php`) to initialize the Slim application.
    3. Define routes for the application's endpoints.
    4. Refactor existing controllers to be compatible with the framework's request/response lifecycle.

## 2. Modernize the Frontend

- **Goal:** Update the frontend to use modern tools and libraries.
- **Steps:**
    1. Remove the outdated Bootstrap 3 dependency from `composer.json`.
    2. Manage frontend dependencies using npm or yarn.
    3. Install Bootstrap 5 and other necessary frontend libraries.
    4. Introduce a build process (e.g., using Webpack or Vite) to compile assets (JavaScript, CSS).
    5. Update the views to use the new assets.

## 3. Implement a Proper MVC Structure

- **Goal:** Enforce a clear separation of concerns between models, views, and controllers.
- **Steps:**
    1. **Models:**
        - Refine the existing models.
        - Create a data access layer (e.g., using repositories) to abstract database interactions.
    2. **Views:**
        - Replace the simple PHP views with a templating engine like [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/).
        - Create a base layout template to maintain a consistent look and feel.
    3. **Controllers:**
        - Refactor controllers to focus on handling HTTP requests and returning responses.
        - Move business logic to separate service classes.

## 4. Improve Database Interaction

- **Goal:** Use a secure and efficient method for database access.
- **Recommendation:** Use a database abstraction layer like PDO or an ORM like Doctrine.
- **Steps:**
    1. Choose and install a suitable database library.
    2. Configure the database connection.
    3. Refactor all database queries to use the new library, ensuring the use of prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

## 5. Enhance Security

- **Goal:** Protect the application from common web vulnerabilities.
- **Steps:**
    1. **XSS Prevention:**
        - Use the chosen templating engine's automatic output escaping feature.
        - Sanitize all user input before storing or displaying it.
    2. **CSRF Protection:**
        - Implement a CSRF protection library or middleware to generate and validate tokens for all form submissions.

## 6. Add Configuration Management

- **Goal:** Separate configuration from code.
- **Recommendation:** Use a library like `vlucas/phpdotenv` to manage environment variables.
- **Steps:**
    1. Create a `.env` file to store environment-specific settings (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
    2. Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file.
    3. Load the environment variables in the application's entry point.

## 7. Implement a Testing Framework

- **Goal:** Ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- **Recommendation:** Use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing.
- **Steps:**
    1. Install PHPUnit via Composer.
    2. Create a `tests` directory to store test files.
    3. Write unit and integration tests for the application's components.
    4. Configure a testing environment and a separate test database.
